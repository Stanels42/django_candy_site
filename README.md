# Django Site

### About
The lab today was to practice creating a basic server with Django. The website needs to have a home and about page as well as use templates to create the pages.
### Approach
The basics of Django are fairly linear. And for this lab most of the steps were written out for us to fallow. ([Link](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-python-401d13/blob/master/class-26/DJANGO_STARTER.md)) I assume this is a series of labs that will take place over the course of a week.
